# AI Study Mentor

## Overview
AI Study Mentor is a Notion-style knowledge organization platform designed to help users structure, process, and study academic materials with integrated AI support. It enables the creation of hierarchical knowledge structures (Subjects → Topics → Content Items), supports uploads of various document types (PDF, Word, PowerPoint), and allows for the addition of external links. Key features include personalized AI summaries, a dual-mode AI assistant for academic and existential support, a teacher-student class system for progress monitoring, and a tiered subscription model. The platform aims to provide a calm and clean interface inspired by Notion, Linear, and Grammarly, combining hierarchical organization with generative AI.

## User Preferences
- Communication: Simple, everyday language (Portuguese)
- Design inspiration: Notion, Linear, Grammarly (calm, clean, organized)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state management. UI components leverage Shadcn/ui, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS, adhering to a Notion-inspired clean design. State management uses TanStack Query for server state and React hooks for local UI state. Form validation is handled by React Hook Form and Zod. Internationalization is implemented using `react-i18next` supporting 6 languages (Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, German, Italian), with user language preferences synced across the application.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js application written in TypeScript, using ESM modules. It provides a RESTful API for managing subjects, topics, content items, and AI chat functionalities. Document processing extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files for AI summarization. Security features include session-based authentication, user ID validation, parent resource ownership checks, Zod validation, and tenant isolation. OpenAI GPT-4 powers all AI functionalities. The system also supports a role-based access control for teacher and student roles.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL (Neon) is the primary database, managed with Drizzle ORM. The schema includes tables for `subjects`, `topics`, `content_items` (supporting files and links), `summaries`, `chat_threads`, `chat_messages`, `users`, `classes`, `classEnrollments`, `classInvites`, `subscriptions`, and `usage_tracking`. Strict foreign key relationships and `ON DELETE CASCADE` ensure data integrity. The `users` table includes a `role` field ("student" or "teacher"). `flashcard_translations` table supports multi-language SM-2 spaced repetition progress across different languages by mapping translated flashcards to a base Portuguese flashcard ID.

### Authentication & Authorization
Authentication uses Replit OIDC with session-based authentication via `express-session`. Authorization is granular, scoping resources to `userId` and validating parent resource ownership. Role-based access control is enforced, requiring users to select a role (student/teacher) upon first login, which dictates access to specific features (e.g., class management for teachers).
